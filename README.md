# ITA Sprint 6: BudgetApp

This project was built as part of **Sprint 6 at the IT Academy**, showcasing my progress in front-end development. It applies core concepts like **HTML, SASS, and Bootstrap 5**, along with **component-service interaction, reactive forms with custom validation, Signals, and parent-child communication.** The result is a **responsive, interactive web app** where users can select services, get an automatic budget estimate, submit validated requests, and view or sort them using dynamic filters.

## Technologies Used

SCSS & Bootstrap for styling
